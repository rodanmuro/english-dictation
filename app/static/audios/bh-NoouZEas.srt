panic remember we're just a block from the

54
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:08,835
white house here this was mid afternoon

55
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:10,995
people spoke to me about racing from the

56
00:02:10,995 --> 00:02:13,235
scene as they heard a burst of gunfire

57
00:02:13,235 --> 00:02:16,115
break out some people fleeing for shelter

58
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:17,635
in a liquor store nearby

59
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,220
now we have had an update as you

60
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,060
heard there from kash patel of the fbi

61
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,540
and other authorities in the last half an

62
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,180
hour they described this as a gunman coming

63
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,740
around the corner from a metro station and

64
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,020
in their words ambushing two national guard troops

65
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,545
in what they have described as a targeted

66
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:36,105
attack

67
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:38,425
now of course their investigation is in a

68
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,065
very initial stage but they will be taking

69
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:42,105
into account

70
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:45,305
the fact that the deployment of national guard

71
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:48,350
troops into american cities by president trump has

72
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,950
been a highly contentious

73
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,190
political move and that coming in the environment

74
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,990
also

75
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,790
of growing political violence in this country but

76
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,950
the authorities to be clear were asked about

77
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,190
any motive and at this stage they've given

78
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,030
no response to that question
